# Library-management-system


A Library Management System is a vital tool designed to manage the various operations of a library, enhancing efficiency and user experience. Developed using the Qt C++ framework and SQLite as the database management system, this application offers a comprehensive solution for handling the day-to-day tasks of a library.

The system allows for the addition, updating, and deletion of both user and book records, all through an intuitive user interface. Leveraging the power of SQLite, it ensures that data is stored securely and can be accessed quickly, even with a large dataset. The system also manages the entire borrowing and delivery process, tracking which books are issued, their due dates, and when they are returned.

By integrating Qt's advanced GUI capabilities with SQLite's reliable database management, this Library Management System not only streamlines library operations but also provides a seamless and responsive experience for librarians and users alike.
